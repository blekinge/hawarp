Spacip [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/shsdev/spacip.png)](https://travis-ci.org/shsdev/spacip) 
============

Introduction
------------

Spacip is a tool to prepare web archive container files in the ARC format which 
are stored in a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) in order to allow 
processing the individual files by means of the SCAPE Platform tool 
[Tomar](https://github.com/openplanets/tomar).

It unpackages flat ARC container files to HDFS, creates a map that allows
identifying which file corresponds to which ARC record, and creates an
input file to be used with [Tomar](https://github.com/openplanets/tomar).

Usage
-----

Invoke the application using hadoop without parameters to get the help
output with parameters that can be used: 

    hadoop jar ./target/spacip-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar  

The following parameters can be used in any order:

    -d,--dir <arg>   HDFS directory containing (the) text file(s) with HDFS
                     paths to container files (e.g. '/user/name/inputdir/').
                     [required].
    -n,--npt <arg>   Number of items to be processed per invokation (e.g. 50).
                     [optional, default: 50].

Important: The input directory (parameter -d) should not contain the ARC files, 
but it must contain (a) text file(s) with absolute HDFS paths to the ARC container 
files, for example:

hadoop jar ./target/spacip-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar  -d /user/name/inputpaths/
 
If the hadoop job runs successfully, various files are created in separate output 
directories.

First there is the directory where the unpacked files are copied:

    /user/name/spacip_unpacked/

Second, there is the job output directory (default: spacip_joboutput) which
contains different output files inside a timestamp directory:

    ./spacip_joboutput/1385143157862/_SUCCESS
    ./spacip_joboutput/1385143157862/_logs
    ./spacip_joboutput/1385143157862/keyfilmapping-m-00000
    ./spacip_joboutput/1385143157862/part-r-00000
    ./spacip_joboutput/1385143157862/ptmapredinput-m-00000

The 'keyfilemapping-*' file contains the container/record-identifier as 
key and the file name as value so that each unpacked file in HDFS can 
be clearly assigned to the corresponding record and the ARC container.

The 'tomarinput-*' file contains the input file which can be used as input
by [Tomar](https://github.com/openplanets/tomar) (-i parameter).

The 'part-r-00000' is an empty reducer file which can be ignored.

Dependencies
------------

This application is using the Cloudera CDH3u5 Hadoop distribution,
see the corresponding dependendy in the maven file:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.hadoop</groupId>
        <artifactId>hadoop-core</artifactId>
        <version>0.20.2-cdh3u5</version>
    </dependency>

The application produces an input file for the SCAPE Platform tool
[Tomar](https://github.com/openplanets/tomar).

Installation
------------

Maven is used to build the application, change to the directory of the
application and type

    mvn install
