/**
 * Hadoop ARC record which can be used as key-value type. This object is used as
 * an intermediate representation of a record. It maps the metadata properties
 * of the ARC record into a flat list which is then used to map the properties
 * to WARC properties. The internal representation of a record is the ArcRecord
 * class which also contains the payload of a record. The payload is read into a
 * byte array, therefore it can hold a maximum of Integer.MAX_VALUE bytes. It is
 * important to note that, depending on the memory available in the cluster, the
 * payload size limit may be much lower.
